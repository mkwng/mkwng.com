                <p>As the George Zimmerman second-degree murder trial winds down, with jurors currently convening for a second day of deliberations, many around the nation are keeping a close eye on what may potentially happen once the verdict is announced.</p>
                <p>Of the many paying close attention to the case is music vet and current Miami resident Timbaland. Speaking to REVOLT about his thoughts on the high-profile trial against Zimmerman, who shot and killed unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin during a physical confrontation in February 2012, Timbo pointed it all to religion.</p>
                <p>“You might look at me when I say this, and don’t take it the wrong way but has anybody talked to God about this?” Timbo asked REVOLT. “God brings all these natural disasters, and you know some people make through and some people don’t. You never know why that boy was walking and why did that happen. You know, you gotta ask God why that happened.”</p>

                <div class="hidden">
                    <p>This comes after many within the music world have been paying tribute to the slain teen through music and through social media by posting photos of their selves sporting hoodies in Martin’s memory. Timbo even offered some kind words for Zimmerman and his family.</p>
                    <p>“I pray for his family because I don’t know, even if though he did it, he’s screwed” the famed producer continued. “He won’t be mentally right ever in his life. You know how many times he probably wake up like ‘I messed up’ and probably cry. It probably won’t be too long until we hear he him take his [own] life.”</p>
                    <p>“Nobody know what happened but God, the Devil and Trayvon and that guy.”</p>
