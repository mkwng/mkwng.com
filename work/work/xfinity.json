When new customers subscribe to Xfinity, there's typically a wait of about a week between confirming and actually getting service into their homes. Through user feedback, they found that customers were very likely to be unsatisfied during this timeframe, particularly because they felt neglected and frustrated at the lack of service.</p>",
  "body2" : "<h3>What I did</h3><p>Working with one other interaction designer, and taking what we knew about Xfinity's service capabilities, we reimagined what the entire experience could be for a brand new customer. We generated user flows and wireframed out each step and every state. Working with a visual designer and a developer, we fleshed out the designs and created an interactive prototype.</p>",

We also reimagined what an intuitive installation guide would be.</p>",
