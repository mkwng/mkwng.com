The way you interact is up to you, but no matter how you use it, Besterday helps remind you that the things that make you happy are already there.</p>",
  "body2" : "<h3>What I did</h3><p>Besterday is a personal project I created on the side. After concepting the idea and running through some rough sketches, I hand coded the front-end of the site from the ground up, often times designing in code. Using the Meteor framework, I built the back-end of the site using node.js.</p>",
