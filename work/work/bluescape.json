They had created a working prototype of giant, wall-sized touch screens, and imagined a new way of working, both locally and remotely, by taking advantage of the latest technologies available. They had the vision, but needed a team to help them define the details in order to make it a reality.</p>",
  "body2" : "<h3>What I did</h3><p>Working with a creative director and another visual designer, I contributed primarily as an interaction designer, fleshing out a whole new platform and all the interactions that came with it. We defined everything from the very basic interactions, like moving and swiping, to the more complex details, like selecting a different pen color or the handling of overlapping elements.</p>",
