Traditionally regarded as 'that discount company,' AARP was also looking for was to provide value to its members in new ways as a service, rather than commodity. What resulted was a new portal to bring travel tips to this audience in a intuitive and useful fashion.</p>",
  "body2" : "<h3>What I did</h3><p>I contributed to this project as an interaction designer and interactive prototyper. Working with the project lead and one other interaction designer, we architected the site, defined user flows and drew out wireframes for each page and state. My contributions also included a few prototypes for user testing, as well as promoting our ideas to the client during presentations.</p>",

  "body3" : "<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>By the end of the project, we had created a brand new tool for AARP that allowed its customers to complete many of the stages of vacation planning. The complete feature set includes a destination finder, destination tips and map explorer, an itinerary planner, and much more.</p>",
