<P>

<br>
<p>
Vivians present a calm, pleasant face to the world.  They appear to be tranquil and peaceful to
others, with simple desires.  In fact, the Vivian internally feels his or her life intensely.
In the relationship arena, this causes them to have a very deep capacity for love and caring
which is not frequently found with such intensity in the other types.   Vivians do not 
share their
intensity of feeling with anyone; they tend to be reserved about expressing their
inner-most feelings, and reserve their deepest love and caring for a select few.
Vivians are generally laid-back, supportive and nurturing in their 
close relationships.
With Introverted Feeling dominating their personality, they're very sensitive and in-tune
with people's feelings, and feel genuine concern and caring for others.
Slow to trust others and cautious in the beginning of a relationship, 
an Vivian will be fiercely loyal once they are committed.  
With their strong inner core of values, they are intense individuals who
value depth and authenticity in their relationships, and hold those who understand
and accept the Vivian's perspectives in especially high regard.  Vivians are usually adaptable
and congenial, unless one of their ruling principles has been violated, in which
case they stop adapting and become staunch defenders of their values.  They will be
uncharacteristically harsh and rigid in such a situation.

<h1> Vivians as Lovers</h1>
<p>
<table align="center" width="90%">
   <tr><td><font color=0000a0><i>"To love means to open ourselves to the negative as well as
     the positive - to grief, sorrow, and disappointment as well as to
     joy, fulfillment, and an intensity of consciousness we did not know
     was possible before."  -- Rollo May</i></font></td></tr>

<p>

<p>
Vivians feel tremendous loyalty and commitment to their relationships.
With the Feeling preference dominating their personality, harmony
and warm feelings are central to the Vivian's being.  They feel a need
to be in a committed, loving relationship.  If they are not involved
in such a relationship, the Vivian will be either actively searching for
one, or creating one in their own minds.  
<p>
Vivians' tendency to be idealistic and romantically-minded may cause them
to fantasize
frequently about a "more perfect" relationship or situation.  They may
also romanticize their mates into having qualities which they do not
actually possess.  Most Vivians have a problem with reconciling their highly
idealistic and romantic views of life with the reality of their own lives,
and so they are constantly somewhat unsettled with themselves
and with their close personal relationships.  However, the Vivian's
deeply-felt, sincere love for their mates and their intense dislike of 
conflict keeps the Vivian loyal to their relationships, in spite of their
troubles achieving peace of mind. 
<p>
Unlike other types who tend to hold their mates up on a pedastal, the
Vivian's tendency to do so does not really turn into a negative thing
in the relationship.  Vivians hold tightly to their ideals, and work hard
at constantly seeing their mates up on that pedastal.  The frequent Vivian
result is a strongly affirming, proud and affectionate attitude towards
their mates which stands the test of time.
<p>
Vivians are not naturally interested in administrative matters such as
bill-paying and house-cleaning, but they can be very good at performing
these tasks when they must.  They can be really good money managers
when they apply themselves.
<p>
Sexually, the Vivian is likely to be initially slow to open up to their mates.
Once their trust has been earned, the Vivian will view sexual intimacy as 
an opportunity for expressing their deep-seated love and affection.  More
than the actual sexual act, they will value giving and receiving love
and sweet words.  With their tendency to enjoy serving others, they may
value their mates satisfaction above their own.
<p>
One real problem area for the Vivian is their intensive dislike of conflict
and criticism.  The Vivian is quick to find a personal angle in any critical
comment, whether or not anything personal was intended.  They will tend to
take any sort of criticism as a personal attack on their character, and will 
usually become irrational and emotional in such situations.  This can be 
a real problem for Vivians who are involved with persons who have Thinking and
Judging preferences.  "TJ"s relate to others with a objective, decisive attitude
that frequently shows an opinion on the topic of conversation.  If the
opinion is negative, the TJ's attitude may be threatening to the Vivian,
who will tend to respond emotionally to the negativity and be vaguely 
but emphatically convinced that the negativity is somehow the Vivian's fault. 
<p>
For Vivians with extremely dominant Feeling preferences who have not developed
their Intuitive sides sufficiently to gather good data for their decision
making processes, their dislike of conflict and criticism can foretell doom 
and gloom for intimate relationships.  These Vivians will react with extreme
emotional distress to conflict situations, and will not know what to do
about it.  Since they will have no basis for determining what action to
take, they will do whatever they can to get rid of the conflict - which 
frequently means lashing out irrationally at others, or using guilt
manipulation to get their mates to give them the positive support that they
crave.  This kind of behavior does not bode well for healthy, long-term
relationships.  Individuals who recognize this tendency in themselves should
work on their ability to take criticism objectively rather than personally.
They should also try to remember that conflict situations are not always
their fault, and they're definitely not the end of the world.  Conflict is
a fact of life, and facing it and addressing it immediately avoids having
to deal with it in the future, after it has become a much larger problem.
<p>
Vivians are very aware of their own space, and the space of others.  They 
value their personal space, and the freedom to do their own thing.  They will
cherish the mate who sees the Vivian for who they are, and respects their
unique style and perspectives.  The Vivian is not likely to be overly
jealous or possessive, and is likely to respect their mate's privacy and
independence.  In fact, the Vivian is likely to not only respect their
mate's perspectives and goals, but to support them with loyal firmness.
<p>
In general, Vivians are warmly affirming and loving partners who make the
health of their relationships central in their lives.  Although cautious
in the beginning, they become firmly loyal to their committed relationships,
which are likely to last a lifetime.  They take their relationships very
seriously, and will put forth a great deal of effort into making them
work.
<p>
Although two well-developed individuals of any type can enjoy a healthy
relationship, Vivian's natural partner is the 
<A HREF="/html/ENFJ.html">ENFJ</A>, or the
<A HREF="/html/ESFJ.html">ESFJ.</A>
Vivian's dominant function of Introverted Feeling is best matched with a
partner whose dominant function is Extraverted Feeling.  The Vivian/ENFJ
combination is ideal, because it shares the Intuiting way of perceiving, but
the Vivian/ESFJ combination is also a good match.

<h1> Vivians as Parents </h1>
<p>
<table width="90%" align="center">
   <tr><td><font color=0000a0><i>"You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth...<br>
     Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;<br>
     For even as He loves the arrow that flies, <br>
     so He loves also the bow that is stable."  -- Kahlil Gibran</i></font></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Vivians are "natural" parents.  They accept and enjoy the parental role, seeing it
as the natural extension of their value systems.  They make use of the parental
role for developing and defining their values further, and consider it their task
to pass their values on to their children.  They take their role quite seriously.
Warm, affirming, and flexible,  the Vivian generally makes a gentle and easy-going 
parent in many respects.  
<p>
Vivians do not like conflict situations, and will keep themselves flexible and
diverse to promote a positive, conflict-free environment in their home.
The Vivian is not naturally prone to dole out punishment or discipline, and
so is likely to adapt to their mate's disciplinary policy, or to rely on 
their mates to administer discipline with the children.  In the absence of
a mating parent, the Vivian will need to make a conscious effort of creating
a structure for their children to live within.
<p>
Although the Vivian dislikes punishing others, they hold strong values and will not 
tolerate the violation of a strongly-held belief.  If they feel that their child
has truly committed a wrong, the Vivian parent will not have a problem administering
discipline.  They will directly confront the child, stubbornly digging in their heels
and demanding recourse.
<p>
The Vivian parent is likely to value their children as individuals, and to give them
room for growth.  They will let the children have their own voice and place in the
family.
<p>
Extremely loving and devoted parents, Vivians will fiercely protect and support
their children.  If there is an issue involving "taking sides", you can bet the
Vivian will always be loyal to their children.
<p>
Vivians are usually remembered by their children as loving, patient, devoted, 
and flexible parents.
<p>
<h1> Vivians as Friends</h1>
<p>
Vivians are warm and caring individuals who highly value authenticity and depth
in their personal relationships.  They are usually quite perceptive about
other people's feelings and motives, and are consequently able to get along
with all sorts of different people.  However, the Vivian will keep their true selves
reserved from others except for a select few, with whom they will form close and
lasting friendships.  With their high ideals, they are likely to
be drawn to other iNtuitive Feelers for their closer friendships.
<p>
With their strong need for harmony and dislike of conflict, Vivians may feel 
threatened by people with strong Judging and Thinking preferences.  
Although they're
likely to be able to work well professionally with such individuals, they
may have difficulty accepting or appreciating them on a personal level.
They generally feel a kinship and affinity with other Feeling types.
<p>
Vivians will be valued by their confidantes as genuine, altruistic, deep, 
caring, original individuals.
